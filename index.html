					<p>When I was just a girl, I expected the world. But it flew away from my reach, so I ran away in my sleep. And at first I was afraid, I was petrified. Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side. Oh mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law. The hangman's coming down from the gallows, and I don't have very long. I get too hungry for dinner at eight. I love the theater, and never come late. I never bother with people I hate. That's why this lady is a tramp.</p>
